          <h4>Keep Software And Plugins Up-To-Date</h4>
          <p>
            Hackers are constantly looking for vulnerabilities in software and
            plugins, and they will exploit them if they find them. If you keep
            your software and plugins up-to-date, you will be less likely to be
            hacked.

          <h4>Add HTTPS and an SSL Certificate</h4>
          <p>
            HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data that is
            transferred between the server and the browser. This makes it
            difficult for hackers to intercept the data. An SSL certificate
            verifies that the website is secure and that the data is encrypted.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Choose a Smart Password</h4>
          <p>
            A strong password is one that is difficult to guess. It should be
            long, and it should contain a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.
            Passwords should also be changed regularly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Use a Secure Web Host</h4>
          <p>
            A secure web host will have a secure server. This means that the
            server will be protected from hackers. It will also have a firewall
            to prevent hackers from accessing the server.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD)</h4>
          <p>
            CI/CD is a software development practice that involves automatically
            building and testing code every time a developer commits a change to
            the code. Any change that does not pass the checks would be rejected
            and flagged for a rework. This practice helps to ensure that the
            code is secure and that it does not contain any vulnerabilities.
